# Data-Science-Project

### The project aims to analyze the retail of walmart:
  - Checking Max sales of months
  - Quarterly sales of walmart.
  - Risk area which impacted the walmart retail sales.
  - Predicted the Weekly_sales of walmart using the ML alorithms.

### Used Python Libraries like Pandas, Numpy , Visualization Library like Matplotlib , used statistical tool to see the independence and Factor affecting the outcome such as OLS from statsmodel & also Machine Learning Algorithm  from sklearn in order to predict the Outcome.

### Alogorithms Used:
Note*: Regression Algorithm  are used as the dataset had dependent variable as continuous value.

  - Linear Regression Algorithm
  - Random Forest Regressor
